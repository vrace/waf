WANE'S ARCHIVE FILE LIBRARY

Wane's Archive File Library is a tiny yet useful library for game developers to
store small files into a big file, which reduces disk cost. Disk cost is
important for some hand held devices.

Main features of the library are:
- Random access within the archive
- Changable compression method (default zlib)

This library consists of two component, the creator and the content reader. The
creator can be used to collect and compress files, while the content reader is
used to read file within the output archive.

All functions of the library are documented in the wafexpc.h. A usage example
of the library is given in the Demo directory.

The files are organized with Visual Studio 2005. However, the files are simple
enough that everyone can reconstruct a project/makefile without any problem.
